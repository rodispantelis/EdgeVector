# EdgeVector
Edge Vector representation is a novel method of representing graphs. It was introduced in [1]. The advantage of this representation is the requirement in memory usage which is minimum, in comparison to competition. Also encoding a graph in Edge Vector or decoding the graph elements from the representation is efficient with polynomial complexity.
