# EdgeVector
Edge Vector representation is a novel method of representing graphs. It was introduced in [1]. The advantage of this representation is the requirement in memory usage which is minimum, in comparison to competition. Also encoding a graph in Edge Vector or decoding the graph elements from the representation is efficient with polynomial complexity.

More details [here.](https://rodispantelis.github.io/EdgeVector/)

In the libraries folder there are coders / decoders implemented in Java and Javascript. Also a Javascript library for converting files from Dimacs format to Edge Vector that is used as a benchmark.

In the randographs folder there is a web application for generating randomgraphs

In the DIMACS folder there graphs from the [Second DIMACS Implementation Challenge](http://archive.dimacs.rutgers.edu/Challenges/), they are provided
